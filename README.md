# Microprocessors
This repository contains the codes I've written for submissions for the module Microprocessors.

## Notes
The programs in this repository are meant to be used in an IDE, like KEIL ÂµVision 4, for the ARM7TDMI-S microcontroller LPC2104. The code is written in assembly language for ARM, which is apparently "radically different" from that for AMD64/Intel 64 bit programming ([Source](https://github.com/mschwartz/assembly-tutorial?tab=readme-ov-file#introduction)).
